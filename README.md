# vrchat-linux-video-workaround
Dumb workaround that allows you to play video player content from a vrchat world in mpv instead, since they don't work in proton yet.

## setup
requires `mpv yt-dlp python3 mono`

build+install with `make install`  
run `vrc-mpv.py` to play videos with mpv when they are requested by vrchat
